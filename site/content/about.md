Hey! I'm Evan.

I am a cybersecurity professional with a passion for all things cloud security. 

My specialty is building and leading security programs, developing scalable automation, and designing secure architectures that move at the speed of modern development. 

I focus on creating systems that improve how risk is identified, contextualized, and addressed. I am especially driven by the challenge of enabling teams and programs to scale securely without slowing down innovation.

This website serves as my personal field notes, guides, blog, and overall anything I am finding enjoyment in.

All thoughts and opinions are my own. Thanks for checking it out.
