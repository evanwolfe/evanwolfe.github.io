# Decisions

As we look to wrap up the year, I have finally managed to get this blog off the ground. Many that know me have asked how it would be possible that I would decide to  spin another plate and start publishing some public content. For me, I'll be keeping things simple here. Sticking mostly to Cloud, Cloud Security, and other general Cybersecurity related content.


## Expectations

What you can expect from this site, in a nutshell:

- Content posted when I can, and when I think it's ready
- Challenges, problems, and puzzles. I want to share what I think is interesting and useful
- Public notes, for me and you to remember things

# About the Blog

I would be remiss not to include some technical details about the blog itself, since it took forever to finally stick to something and just move forward. As a side note, if you are reading this and thinking you would like a blog yourself but don't know what to pick from, you are not alone. There are an overwhelming amount of options to choose from, and even with AI assistance, you have to know what you want and what you like aesthetically. My advice? find something that looks nice, replicate it, and move forward.

That being said, here's where I landed:

- Hugo (fast, well documented)
- Blowfish theme (Customized, clean, had some features I wanted) 
- GitHub Pages (free, simple CI setup)
- GitHub Actions (said simple CI setup)

That's about it. For now...

## Tradeoffs

I know what you are thinking:
> why use free services and open source to build static web content instead of building a Kubernetes cluster and deploying it with multiple cloud provider lock-in services for a single pod dynamic web page? 

The answer? I would probably spend most of my time on what it takes to host the blog, instead of what goes in the blog.
